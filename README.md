This project builds a classification model on Japanese data to predict phone buyers, justifying model choices using module concepts. It interprets variable coefficients, evaluates performance via metrics, and estimates potential phone buyers in the Indian market.

**#TASKS ACCOMPLISHED** 
1.Cleaned and preprocessed data (handled missing values, encoded categories).
2.Selected meaningful features based on correlation and business relevance.
3.Built and trained a classification model to predict purchase intent.
4.Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
5.Interpreted coefficients to understand what factors influence buying decisions.
6.Applied the model to Indian consumer data to estimate potential customers.

**#RESULT**
>The model helped identify key drivers like income, age, and car purchase details.
>Achieved over 80% accuracy on test data.
>Estimated that around 42% of similar Indian consumers would likely buy a new car
